-put 'omit_these' arrays into config file
-CURRENT:
   -Items parse done, test factions now
   -Test faction parses before inserting
   

--OOPS:
   -From START to A bloodgill barracuda, we falsely did some INSERTS into items tables. So, npc_loot is tainted
   -From START to A black mamba, we falsely did some INSERTs into npc_zone table:
   -From START to second entry, we falsely did some INSERTs into Factions tables:
            --^^ therefor first two entries will have duplicate
      -Either go back and re run the entire parse, of try to snipe those inserts out
   --SOLUTIONS FOR NEXT TIME:
      -Needed constraints on the NPC tables
      -Perhaps, when we run these alter table and / or insert functions, put in some sort of 'Are you sure?' prompt in the console
   
FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
   -Parse 'items' wiki
   -
